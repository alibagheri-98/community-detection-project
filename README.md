# community-detection-project

Within this repository, you'll discover a project centered around the theme of "Graph Clustering Methods." Our approach involves employing community detection algorithms for effective clustering. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the practical applications of probability to students. Alongside this, participants will gain exposure to the realm of recommender systems. Notably, we crafted and executed this project during our tenure as teaching assistants for the probability course at Sharif University of Technology. I had the privilege of leading this initiative.

We employed innovative methods in the development of this project. Given that "community detection" is a relatively new field without a dedicated reference book, we reviewed relevant research papers to formulate questions for the project. Throughout the project's design phase and even after its release, we continued to explore novel approaches to assist students with any challenges they encountered in relation to this topic. As a result of our pioneering efforts, we are submitting a research paper to introduce our groundbreaking approach.

Note:
- "Phase 1.pdf" is the first phase of the project.
- "Phase 2.pdf" is the second phase of the project.
- "Project_in_Persian_Language" contains the files of both phases, but translated into Persian language.
